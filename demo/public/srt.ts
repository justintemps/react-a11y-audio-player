00:00:03,418 --> 00:00:07,818
Hello, and welcome to this edition
of the ILO's Future of Work podcast.

3
00:00:08,305 --> 00:00:10,720
I'm Isabel Piquer at the ILO in Geneva.

4
00:00:10,967 --> 00:00:14,858
Today, we are going to talk
about gender equality and inclusion,

5
00:00:15,178 --> 00:00:17,469
particularly now in these times of COVID.

6
00:00:21,738 --> 00:00:27,010
Our guest today is Chidi King,
head of the Gender, Equality, Diversity,

7
00:00:27,287 --> 00:00:29,243
and Inclusion branch of the ILO.

8
00:00:29,454 --> 00:00:30,770
-Hi, Chidi.
-Hello.

9
00:00:31,025 --> 00:00:34,036
We will organize the interview
around three main topics.

10
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:36,647
First, we will discuss the effects
of the pandemic

11
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:38,967
on the most vulnerable population.

12
00:00:39,221 --> 00:00:43,323
Then we'll look at what exactly the ILO
is doing to promote equality

13
00:00:43,512 --> 00:00:47,861
and inclusion in the world of work,
and then we will talk

14
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:51,490
about the challenges that lie ahead
in view of the profound changes

15
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:54,574
that already taking place
in the world of work.

16
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:57,054
Let's start with the pandemic.

17
00:00:57,243 --> 00:01:00,087
It seems that, once again,
vulnerable populations

18
00:01:00,276 --> 00:01:02,501
have paid the price of this crisis.

19
00:01:02,894 --> 00:01:05,200
This has been particularly true for women.

20
00:01:05,527 --> 00:01:10,378
Have we really taken a step back
as all the reports seem to indicate?

21
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:15,461
Unfortunately, I would have to say yes
in response to that.

22
00:01:15,956 --> 00:01:18,690
All the data and indications
that we have show

23
00:01:18,894 --> 00:01:22,101
that women have suffered
disproportionately, once again,

24
00:01:23,178 --> 00:01:27,200
as a result of both the health
and the socioeconomic consequences

25
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,032
of the pandemic.

26
00:01:29,309 --> 00:01:34,385
To give a concrete example,
we know that 4.2% of women's employment

27
00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:36,887
was destroyed as a result of the pandemic.

28
00:01:37,112 --> 00:01:40,974
This compares with 3% of men's employment.

29
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,094
This is because of a combination
of factors.

30
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:49,396
One being that, due to this persistent
gender-based occupational segregation,

31
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,625
and that we have women
were overrepresented

32
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:58,116
in some of the hardest-hit sectors
of the economy, for example,

33
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:02,807
in hotel and tourism, in textile
and garment global supply chains,

34
00:02:02,996 --> 00:02:07,570
and other supply chains
which were very severely

35
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,294
negatively impacted
by the economic shutdown

36
00:02:12,589 --> 00:02:16,472
that came as a result of the lockdowns
put in place to contain the virus.

37
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,578
Of course, we've seen that women
are not a homogenous group.

38
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:23,818
Women
who were fairing particularly poorly,

39
00:02:24,007 --> 00:02:28,821
pre-pandemic, linked to discrimination
on the grounds of factors such as race,

40
00:02:29,141 --> 00:02:33,592
ethnicity, disability, gender identity,
and sexual orientation,

41
00:02:34,174 --> 00:02:37,083
and, of course, the socioeconomic status,
have certainly seen

42
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:40,145
their situation deteriorate further.

43
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:42,930
All of this points
to the really urgent need

44
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,170
to tackle these structural barriers
that have been in place for so long,

45
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,876
and that have really hampered
the goal of achieving

46
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:54,414
gender equality and equity.

47
00:02:55,076 --> 00:02:58,610
It's not only women
who have been deeply impacted

48
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:03,170
by the pandemic, also migrant workers
who represent 4.7%

49
00:03:03,396 --> 00:03:07,796
of the global labor pool,
approximately 164 million workers?

50
00:03:07,992 --> 00:03:09,207
They certainly have.

51
00:03:09,454 --> 00:03:12,967
Again, this is largely because
of the structural factors

52
00:03:13,156 --> 00:03:18,218
that I was pointing to,
including discrimination in labor markets,

53
00:03:18,545 --> 00:03:22,392
including what we would refer to
as decent work deficits.

54
00:03:22,581 --> 00:03:28,632
So not having adequate social protection,
not having secure employment,

55
00:03:28,821 --> 00:03:35,170
not having a predictable income,
not having access to things

56
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,610
such as maternal protection and benefits.

57
00:03:38,807 --> 00:03:42,385
Since most migrant workers are found
in sectors of the economy

58
00:03:42,574 --> 00:03:46,843
with high levels of temporary, informal,
and unprotected work,

59
00:03:47,236 --> 00:03:50,690
including in care worked,
in which many countries

60
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,272
are primarily carried out by women, right?

61
00:03:53,592 --> 00:03:58,589
Of course, migrant workers
are very often in a precarious situation

62
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,385
in relation to their status
in a particular country.

63
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:09,207
If, for example, your work permit
is linked to a particular job

64
00:04:09,643 --> 00:04:13,163
and that job disappeared
during the pandemic,

65
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,312
then you can see, very easily,
how your situation becomes

66
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:19,694
even more precarious,
and how you may even become stranded

67
00:04:19,883 --> 00:04:23,876
because your situation in the country
is no longer regular,

68
00:04:24,094 --> 00:04:28,298
through nothing that you have done,
but just as a consequence

69
00:04:28,974 --> 00:04:32,189
of an external factor
such as the pandemic.

70
00:04:32,516 --> 00:04:36,058
Yet, at the same time, we were seeing
just how crucial migrant workers

71
00:04:36,247 --> 00:04:41,040
were to our economies,
particularly in industrialized economies.

72
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,821
We know, and we saw, during the pandemic,
that migrant workers

73
00:04:45,054 --> 00:04:48,341
are very often the backbone
of these economies.

74
00:04:48,596 --> 00:04:50,829
Working in sectors
such as health and care,

75
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:54,923
working as domestic workers,
working as cleaners,

76
00:04:55,112 --> 00:04:57,381
working as sanitation.

77
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,381
Providing sanitation services,
working in food retail.

78
00:05:03,643 --> 00:05:07,592
All of those services which proved
to be so essential or have proven

79
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,301
to be so essential
throughout this pandemic,

80
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:14,901
see an over-representation
of migrant workers.

81
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:19,745
Yet they find themselves
in some of the most vulnerable employment

82
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:21,294
and work situations.

83
00:05:21,556 --> 00:05:27,650
Again, this gives an indication
of the urgency to eradicate inequalities,

84
00:05:28,072 --> 00:05:32,203
particularly in our macroeconomic systems.

85
00:05:32,574 --> 00:05:35,025
The pandemic has really made things worse.

86
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,189
Let's see now what can be done.
What can we do?

87
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:42,763
Isabel, maybe I can start by explaining
that the ILO is a UN agency.

88
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,770
Of course, it is unique in the sense

89
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:51,541
that it is the only tripartite UN agency
bringing together governments, workers,

90
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:55,149
employers' organizations,
and workers' organizations.

91
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,163
These constituents of the ILO
come together to both elaborate

92
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:06,952
policy solutions to challenges
that we face in the world of work,

93
00:06:07,527 --> 00:06:12,872
and also to put in place legal frameworks
to guide our world of work.

94
00:06:13,454 --> 00:06:16,930
The global community has pledged
to leave no one behind

95
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:20,967
when adopting the 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development.

96
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,152
It all sounds very commendable, very well,
but what is the ILO doing exactly

97
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:27,563
to ensure that?

98
00:06:27,752 --> 00:06:32,981
Just before the pandemic hit in 2019,
the ILO was celebrating 100 years

99
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,341
of the International Labor Conference.

100
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:41,010
At that conference,
there were two particular documents

101
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,287
that the ILO constituents were working on.

102
00:06:43,578 --> 00:06:48,247
One was a Centenary Declaration,
so, a forward-looking declaration.

103
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:52,523
What was the future of our world of work
going to look like?

104
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,272
Of course, at the time,
we weren't envisaging

105
00:06:55,636 --> 00:06:58,538
that just a year later,
a global health pandemic

106
00:06:58,727 --> 00:07:02,087
with such significant
socioeconomic fallouts

107
00:07:02,407 --> 00:07:04,749
was going to be upon us.

108
00:07:05,563 --> 00:07:08,981
The constituents elaborated
this Centenary Declaration.

109
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,872
Part of that was calling
for a transformative agenda

110
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,454
for gender equality to accelerate

111
00:07:16,152 --> 00:07:20,094
the results, which have been insufficient,

112
00:07:20,283 --> 00:07:21,905
to date, in this area.

113
00:07:22,305 --> 00:07:28,160
The second document or set of documents
that were adopted, that were worked on,

114
00:07:28,356 --> 00:07:31,832
negotiated
during this particular conference,

115
00:07:32,196 --> 00:07:33,469
were legal instruments.

116
00:07:33,694 --> 00:07:39,352
It was a legal framework to ensure
that we can finally start to address

117
00:07:39,607 --> 00:07:44,480
and put an end to violence
and harassment in the world of work.

118
00:07:44,996 --> 00:07:49,229
Of course,
this has a particular gender dimension,

119
00:07:49,527 --> 00:07:51,163
which is reflected in the instruments.

120
00:07:51,476 --> 00:07:55,003
The instruments also recognize
that vulnerable populations,

121
00:07:55,309 --> 00:08:00,356
such as those we've spoken of earlier,
are particularly badly affected

122
00:08:00,894 --> 00:08:03,629
by violence and harassment
in our world of work.

123
00:08:03,898 --> 00:08:06,021
Coming out of this Centenary Declaration,
of course,

124
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,876
a year later we saw the pandemic.

125
00:08:08,065 --> 00:08:13,905
Earlier this year, the ILO's constituents,
workers, employers, governments, again,

126
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:19,476
adopted a global call to action
for human-centered recovery

127
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,887
to the pandemic.

128
00:08:21,076 --> 00:08:24,989
This outlines a comprehensive agenda,
committing countries to ensuring

129
00:08:25,178 --> 00:08:29,490
that their economic and social recovery
is fully inclusive, sustainable,

130
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:34,938
and resilient and that it does place
gender equality at its heart.

131
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,665
How can we translate
these goals of gender equality

132
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:42,821
and promoting inclusive
and sustainable growth

133
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:47,629
in the day-to-day life,
in the life of the businesses of workers?

134
00:08:47,825 --> 00:08:49,883
Give me some concrete examples.

135
00:08:50,152 --> 00:08:56,545
The convention that I just talked about
is one very concrete example,

136
00:08:56,734 --> 00:09:00,014
Convention 190
and its accompanying recommendation.

137
00:09:00,203 --> 00:09:03,061
That's how the ILO works
in terms of setting law.

138
00:09:04,821 --> 00:09:06,850
The conventions
are binding legal documents

139
00:09:07,061 --> 00:09:12,130
once they're adopted and ratified
by countries, and recommendations

140
00:09:12,407 --> 00:09:15,592
give supplementary guidance
on how the conventions

141
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,192
should be implemented.

142
00:09:17,381 --> 00:09:23,498
This is quite an innovative convention,
and it protects all workers irrespective

143
00:09:23,738 --> 00:09:25,069
of their contractual status.

144
00:09:25,287 --> 00:09:29,578
It also protects workers,
whether they're working in rural

145
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:33,941
or urban areas,
whether they are actually job seekers.

146
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,669
Whether they're about
to enter the workforce

147
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:38,698
or haven't quite entered it yet.

148
00:09:38,952 --> 00:09:44,421
Whether they retired from the workforce,
so, it's quite all-encompassing.

149
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:50,974
It really looks at the world of work
as being beyond just a physical building,

150
00:09:51,374 --> 00:09:53,694
for instance,
such as an office or a factory.

151
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:59,389
It recognizes that public spaces
can be places of work,

152
00:09:59,592 --> 00:10:02,240
particularly for workers
in the informal economy.

153
00:10:02,487 --> 00:10:05,658
Again, for many women, we know
that the informal economy

154
00:10:05,847 --> 00:10:08,661
is where they are to be found working.

155
00:10:09,221 --> 00:10:14,974
The fact that this convention recognizes
the specificities of gender-based violence

156
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:17,483
and harassment
and that particular measures

157
00:10:17,927 --> 00:10:22,887
need to be taken to address that,
that it recognizes the fact

158
00:10:23,192 --> 00:10:27,418
that groups vulnerable to discrimination
and inequality are likely

159
00:10:27,636 --> 00:10:30,196
to be more exposed
to violence and harassment.

160
00:10:30,545 --> 00:10:34,887
That places such as the home,
for instance, where many are teleworking,

161
00:10:35,112 --> 00:10:38,523
or where many may be working
as home-based workers, indeed,

162
00:10:38,712 --> 00:10:41,774
in global supply chains,
are also part of our world of work

163
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:46,465
and areas in which violence
and harassment need to be eradicated,

164
00:10:46,669 --> 00:10:48,829
a very concrete step

165
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,247
towards advancing towards gender equality.

166
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:57,483
Because whilst gender-based violence
and harassment, in particular,

167
00:10:57,752 --> 00:11:00,567
continues to exist,
we cannot achieve gender equality,

168
00:11:00,756 --> 00:11:03,607
or indeed, decent work for women.

169
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:09,403
Yes, and it seems that the future
that awaits us, are already here,

170
00:11:09,592 --> 00:11:11,461
it's not going to make things easier.

171
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:17,192
It looks sometimes a little scary
because COVID has brought up

172
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:20,021
disruptive changes,
but they are by no means

173
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,705
the only one we're going to face
in the future.

174
00:11:22,923 --> 00:11:27,243
We're talking about remote work,
or e-commerce, or automation,

175
00:11:27,432 --> 00:11:29,723
I think they can bring
lot of good changes,

176
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,512
but also a lot of challenges.

177
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,814
Let's not forget, of course,

178
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,836
-the looming climate emergency,
-Absolutely.

179
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,800
whilst of course ensuring just transition
for workers.

180
00:11:39,614 --> 00:11:44,770
If we're not addressing
the already existing inequalities

181
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,520
that we all recognize,
then these are only going

182
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,603
to be further exacerbated
by the rapid pace of change.

183
00:11:50,814 --> 00:11:54,370
This is part
of what the ILO Centenary Declaration,

184
00:11:55,454 --> 00:12:00,305
and indeed, the COVID-19 call to action

185
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:03,250
are meant to address.

186
00:12:03,621 --> 00:12:06,174
If we're not confronting these challenges,
head-on,

187
00:12:06,385 --> 00:12:08,901
if we're not putting in place
the right frameworks,

188
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,305
whether it's the legal frameworks,
the policy interventions,

189
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:16,378
including enabling women,
whether it's through

190
00:12:16,712 --> 00:12:19,650
their employers' organizations,
or through their workers' organizations

191
00:12:19,876 --> 00:12:24,690
to have a real voice in crafting the way

192
00:12:25,105 --> 00:12:27,840
our future world of work, which is now—

193
00:12:28,036 --> 00:12:30,247
It has to be said, the future is really--

194
00:12:30,436 --> 00:12:33,418
-We're already there.
-Exactly, we're already there.

195
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,403
If they're not having a real say
in crafting this world of work,

196
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:43,709
then these challenges certainly
are only going to persist and get worse.

197
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,203
The world of work indeed
will get worse for everybody,

198
00:12:46,392 --> 00:12:51,512
for employers and workers alike
because where discrimination is embedded,

199
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:54,916
everyone ultimately suffers.

200
00:12:55,578 --> 00:12:58,210
There's a lot of talk, of course,
about remote work.

201
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,189
This can bring many benefits.

202
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,472
It can also bring some risks
that we need to be alert to.

203
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:12,443
With women, very often we hear it said
that "Oh, this provides

204
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,621
a wonderful opportunity
to balance your work

205
00:13:15,883 --> 00:13:17,520
and your family responsibilities."

206
00:13:17,752 --> 00:13:21,680
Ignoring, of course, that actually,
those family responsibilities

207
00:13:21,912 --> 00:13:25,650
are also work.
Unpaid work, granted, but also work.

208
00:13:26,007 --> 00:13:31,527
The toll that this also takes
when we don't build into our policies

209
00:13:31,752 --> 00:13:34,436
when we don't build
into our workplace planning,

210
00:13:34,763 --> 00:13:37,636
when we don't have a proper dialogue
that ensures that issues

211
00:13:37,912 --> 00:13:42,232
are addressed correctly,
that it brings with it all kinds of risks,

212
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,243
including psychosocial risks,
a higher burden of stress,

213
00:13:45,432 --> 00:13:51,498
a higher risk of mental illness
and mental breakdowns, and so on.

214
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:56,101
Let's not forget that for many,
remote working,

215
00:13:56,334 --> 00:14:02,945
teleworking is really just not an option
because the kinds of jobs that workers

216
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,425
are engaged in
do not allow for remote work.

217
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:08,669
It's care workers who have been very much
in the vanguard

218
00:14:08,923 --> 00:14:11,614
of addressing the pandemic,
whether it's our workers

219
00:14:11,803 --> 00:14:13,905
in the informal economy,
whether it's our workers

220
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:17,898
in the agricultural sector
who have made sure that we're all able

221
00:14:18,261 --> 00:14:21,650
to keep putting food on our table,
remote work is just not an option.

222
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,898
Ensuring decent work for these workers,
ensuring that they have democracy

223
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:27,920
in their places of work,
ensuring that they have

224
00:14:28,116 --> 00:14:33,025
adequate social protection
and labor protections, is absolutely key.

225
00:14:33,221 --> 00:14:38,778
That's something that doesn't change
regardless of the rapidly changing nature

226
00:14:39,061 --> 00:14:40,378
of our world of work.

227
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:44,305
Yes, we've discovered that machines
can discriminate as much or worse

228
00:14:44,494 --> 00:14:49,847
than people because sometimes,
algorithms can also discriminate

229
00:14:50,036 --> 00:14:52,567
against women or minorities

230
00:14:54,756 --> 00:14:57,941
in a way that people already did,

231
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,570
-but more efficient and terrible.
-Absolutely.

232
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,083
This is an area that the ILO
is certainly turning its focus to,

233
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:09,629
seeing that the biases that already exist
in our world of work,

234
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:13,396
those ingrained inequalities,

235
00:15:13,585 --> 00:15:16,145
and discriminatory factors

236
00:15:16,407 --> 00:15:17,970
that we've talked about already.

237
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,636
Of course, when developing algorithms
are quite often built

238
00:15:21,825 --> 00:15:27,738
into those algorithms,
deepening discrimination,

239
00:15:28,356 --> 00:15:32,072
and inequalities, and we've seen this
along the lines of race.

240
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,632
Particular, we've seen it
along the lines of gender as well,

241
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,701
that, very often when these codes
are written, they're written

242
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,930
with a particular person in mind.

243
00:15:43,185 --> 00:15:45,650
That person very often
tends to be a White,

244
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:48,312
middle-class, male person.

245
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:49,687
Yes, absolutely.

246
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,770
I'd like to talk
about persons with disabilities.

247
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,007
I think we don't talk enough about them
generally,

248
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,669
that 15% of the world population,

249
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,861
they've also been deeply impacted
by the pandemic.

250
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:08,043
They already face marginalization
as well as a limitation

251
00:16:08,232 --> 00:16:10,334
by public services to reach them.

252
00:16:10,618 --> 00:16:13,592
Do you think that the use of technology,
particularly teleworking,

253
00:16:13,781 --> 00:16:16,109
can offer them new possibilities?

254
00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:19,520
Because I remember
we published an article, not so long ago,

255
00:16:19,716 --> 00:16:24,363
about a person with disability,
and he said that, thanks to remote work,

256
00:16:24,552 --> 00:16:27,614
he had found new opportunities of working.

257
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:33,432
Is this future of work going
to be worse or better,

258
00:16:33,738 --> 00:16:35,803
or maybe we don't know yet?

259
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:40,021
I think it's certainly,
technology can be quite instrumental

260
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:44,960
in improving the lives,
and particularly the access

261
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:48,960
to labor markets of persons
with disabilities.

262
00:16:49,338 --> 00:16:54,763
Teleworking can be a good option
for some persons with disabilities,

263
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:59,694
but it's not a panacea,
and it's certainly not the only solution.

264
00:16:59,956 --> 00:17:05,163
Those factors that I mentioned earlier,
the relating to the decent work agenda,

265
00:17:05,447 --> 00:17:07,076
again, absolutely critical.

266
00:17:07,265 --> 00:17:11,134
We need to be conscious of issues
such as the need to ensure-

267
00:17:11,374 --> 00:17:13,505
just as you would need to,

268
00:17:13,694 --> 00:17:18,087
if the worker were in an office setting,

269
00:17:18,312 --> 00:17:21,992
for instance, or factory, again,
you would need to ensure

270
00:17:22,269 --> 00:17:25,192
that reasonable accommodations
or adaptations were in place.

271
00:17:25,425 --> 00:17:29,483
You would need to ensure
that a worker with a disability

272
00:17:29,672 --> 00:17:35,170
working from home, teleworking,
has reasonable adaptations

273
00:17:35,418 --> 00:17:38,450
and accommodations in place to allow them
to perform their work safely,

274
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,832
securely, and productively.

275
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:45,338
We need to be aware
of some of the risks as well,

276
00:17:45,527 --> 00:17:49,389
risk factors that might come into play
such as isolation.

277
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:54,792
This can already be aggravated for persons
with certain types of disabilities.

278
00:17:54,981 --> 00:18:01,025
Again, if you're teleworking
and not having daily contact

279
00:18:01,221 --> 00:18:06,116
or in an environment with other people,
the risks of isolation

280
00:18:06,312 --> 00:18:08,494
can worsen psychosocial risks.

281
00:18:08,894 --> 00:18:13,432
Again, can be part of the fallout
of that isolation.

282
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:18,269
We need to be alert and conscious
and mitigate those risks,

283
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,869
whilst all the while looking
at how we can make telework

284
00:18:22,058 --> 00:18:25,330
a decent work option
for persons with disabilities.

285
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,909
Again, we need to remember that,
for many developing economies

286
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,683
where most persons with disabilities
are trying to eke a living

287
00:18:34,872 --> 00:18:38,050
in the informal economy,
telework is just not an option.

288
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:43,090
Again, concerted efforts to ensure
that persons with disabilities

289
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,036
are actually part
of the socioeconomic response

290
00:18:47,054 --> 00:18:52,276
and to the health response, indeed,
of the pandemic, are absolutely crucial.

291
00:18:54,305 --> 00:19:01,185
The ILO's call to action, I think,
is again geared towards ensuring this.

292
00:19:01,803 --> 00:19:05,170
What we're seeing, unfortunately, is that,
in most of the data collection efforts

293
00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:09,549
that are being made to assess
the impact of the pandemic,

294
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,970
we're not seeing data being
desegregated by disability yet.

295
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:17,541
We really do need
some further concerted efforts

296
00:19:17,898 --> 00:19:20,298
in this area,
so that the right frameworks,

297
00:19:20,516 --> 00:19:22,807
the right policies,
the right interventions

298
00:19:23,032 --> 00:19:26,792
with the voice of workers
with disabilities,

299
00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:29,498
are actually crafted and put in place.

300
00:19:29,912 --> 00:19:32,930
There's still a lot, a lot of work
ahead of us.

301
00:19:33,243 --> 00:19:36,007
Chidi, thank you very much for your time.

302
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:41,527
Our guest today was Chidi King,
head of the Gender, Equality, Diversity,

303
00:19:41,716 --> 00:19:44,712
and Inclusion branch of the ILO.

304
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:50,116
Please join us soon for another edition
of the ILO Future of Work podcast.

305
00:19:50,509 --> 00:19:51,600
Goodbye.
